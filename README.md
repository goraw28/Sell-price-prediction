# Sell-price-prediction

Case Study/Project_Multiple Linear Regression: Given below with Used Car data build a machine learning model that can predict Sell Price based on different features ex-Mileage and Age of Cars

We have a dataset containing prices of used BMW cars. 
We are going to analyze this dataset and build a prediction function that can predict a price by taking mileage and age of the car as input. 
We will use sklearn train_test_split method
We perform Linear regression on the data
Also use the Regularisation techniques
Finally created google sheet to implement and deploy the output
final predictions deployed on google sheet
